		<description><![CDATA[[...] NVRAM Programmer @ 8 Bit Spaghetti. Kyle writes -  For the control matrix of my computer I am using some NVRAM chips to store a 16-bit control word for the various registers and control wires of my CPU. I decided not to use EEPROM as the chips that I bought were all faulty and wouldn&#8217;t write (I consulted many people and they agreed). I also decided that moving breadboard wires around was an extremely inefficient way to program 70 control words at 70 addresses. Which is why I decided to create a simple NVRAM (or EEPROM) programmer using the Arduino to send out addresses and data as well as control the write enable pin. My sketch cycles through bytes of data in an array of a specified length. My code is available for anyone who would find it useful, it can be modified quite easily for your programming needs.
