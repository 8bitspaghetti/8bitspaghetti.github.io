		<description><![CDATA[An early rough draft of a book about TTL CPU design and related topics is available at:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Microprocessor_Design/Wire_Wrap

You can help us make it better. (I hope Kyle is happy I added a link from that book to 8 bit spaghetti).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kyle,

Cool project!

Another interesting book on the subject, is &quot;Code: The hidden language of computer hardware and software&quot;. it is much lighter theoretically, but an excellent and fun read. Probably the best book to come out of Microsoft Press ever (it has nothing to do with windows or microsoft, cant even remember if windows is ever mentioned)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read all your posts, but just in case you&#039;re not aware, there&#039;s a ton of information relevant to your computer cpu design if you search for bit-sliced design, microarchitecture, or micro-programmed design. As I recall, I think this was really becoming formalized and widely available around 1978 or so. AMD was one of the main vendors of the bit-slice components, and they had lots of info. Or maybe you&#039;re trying to get down even closer to the nuts and bolts.]]></description>
