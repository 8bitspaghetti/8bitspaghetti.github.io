		<description><![CDATA[Go ahead and try using them. There is a good chance that during the first run of my ALU for the first computer I was going to build (4-bit) that I may have fried the chips. There is also a chance that they were defective to begin with though as some chips that I did not use initially still had problems. I got my batch from a Fry&#039;s as well. My suggestion would be to try a few parts just to test the water, NTE parts are meant for replacement but should function just like standard chips.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you use NTE chips at all? My local fry&#039;s stocks pretty much every 7400 and 4000-series chips there are but the are all NTE. However I found my NTE 74HC02 is just a re-branded TI 74HC02 with the original markings painted over.]]></description>
