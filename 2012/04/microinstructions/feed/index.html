		<description><![CDATA[There are two blocks in the diagram, one for the instruction and one for the control word. The control word is 16 bits long and requires two 8-bit ROM chips.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s fine, ask as many questions as you like. What you are describing is what I was talking about in my previous comment. A variable machine cycle is when the control matrix detects when a NOP control word is present (by using an AND or NAND gate) and clears the ring counter so that the next instruction cycle can begin. I wish you luck with your project.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is there a particular reason for wanting each op to take three T-states? As the fetch T-states are executed for every instruction, it effectively makes every op take 6 T-states, so reducing the Fetch to 2 T-states would reduce runtime by 16%. I guess you would want to burn off some more clock cycles for a NOP (for example if you are waiting for something to happen) because you would need three times as many NOP instructions in memory to get a 6-clock delay - I&#039;m wondering if there is something else I&#039;ve overlooked.

Sorry for all of the questions, I&#039;ve just started designing my own homebrew CPU partly based on your design and I&#039;m trying to work out if there are any obvious things I&#039;ve missed, so &quot;Because I want to&quot; is just as helpful an answer as something more technical :)]]></description>
