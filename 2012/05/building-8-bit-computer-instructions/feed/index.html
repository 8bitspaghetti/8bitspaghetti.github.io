		<description><![CDATA[Going to attempt to build my own computer again.
I built one many years ago actually using the same book (and it essentialy worked) as you did for a reference. I am surprised it is still usefull and current.
I got bogged down on software.
I gave up when I couldn&#039;t figure out how to program an EEPROM
Probably will buy a burner his time.
I hope to learn as much from you as possible.
I would be great if there was some way to share code.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article and Instructable! This is something they should get groups to do at Uni (when studying computer science). I was thinking, if you managed to tidy up the cables (say, with cable ties) and routed them in the correct way it would expose much more of the circuitry and make the whole thing more visually appealing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kyle , Iâ€™m stalled out on microcoding my control rom at the moment and I got distracted by that 1-bit CPU concept that circulated on HAD about a month ago but I should be able to get back in gear and finish it up in the next week or so. Do you have any video of yours in action?]]></description>
